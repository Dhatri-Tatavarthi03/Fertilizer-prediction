# Fertilizer-prediction
This project aims to develop a fertilizer prediction system using a Random Forest Classifier to recommend the optimal fertilizer based on key agricultural parameters. The system assists farmers and agricultural professionals in making informed decisions about fertilizer use, enhancing crop yield and quality while promoting sustainable farming practices.

Key Features
Data-Driven Recommendations: Provides precise fertilizer recommendations based on moisture, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, soil type, and crop type.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier for high accuracy and robustness.
Environmental Sustainability: Promotes sustainable farming by minimizing overuse or misuse of fertilizers.
Objectives
Predict the optimal fertilizer for various crop types.
Enhance crop yield and quality.
Reduce environmental impact.
Methodology
Data Collection: Gather data on moisture, nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, soil type, and crop type.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
Model Training: Train the Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model parameters to enhance its predictive capability.
Benefits
Informed Decision-Making: Data-driven fertilizer recommendations help farmers make informed decisions.
Cost Efficiency: Optimized fertilizer usage reduces costs associated with over-fertilization.
Sustainability: Promotes sustainable farming practices by preventing nutrient runoff and soil degradation.
Installation
